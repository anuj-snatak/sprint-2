# 📘 Monorepo vs Microrepo Strategy – Documentation

---

## ✅ Purpose

This document is intended to provide a **detailed comparison and understanding of Monorepo and Microrepo (Polyrepo)** strategies in software development. It aims to guide organizations, developers, and DevOps teams in selecting the most suitable repository structure for their workflows, scalability needs, and CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 📖 Introduction

Modern software engineering involves managing multiple services, teams, and codebases. Choosing the right repository strategy—**Monorepo** or **Microrepo**—is crucial for long-term maintainability, collaboration, and operational efficiency.

---

### 🔷 What is a Monorepo?

A **Monorepo (Monolithic Repository)** is a single version-controlled repository that contains **multiple related projects or services**. All teams work within a unified codebase with a shared history.

**Key Characteristics:**

* All services and libraries are stored together
* Centralized build and test workflows
* Shared dependency and version management

**Example Users:** Google, Meta, Uber, Twitter

---

### 🔶 What is a Microrepo (Polyrepo)?

A **Microrepo (Polyrepo)** strategy keeps **each service, component, or library in its own separate Git repository**. Teams manage their own repositories independently.

**Key Characteristics:**

* Independent deployment and release cycles
* Fine-grained access control
* Decoupled development workflows

**Example Users:** Amazon, Netflix, many microservices-based startups

## 📊 Comparison Table: Monorepo vs Microrepo

| Feature/Criteria         | Monorepo                                              | Microrepo (Polyrepo)                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Codebase Location**    | Single shared repository                              | Separate repositories for each service/module         |
| **Versioning**           | Often unified across modules                          | Independent versioning for each project               |
| **Code Sharing**         | Easy via shared modules/libraries in the repo         | Requires publishing shared packages                   |
| **CI/CD Integration**    | Centralized CI/CD pipelines                           | Decentralized CI/CD per repo                          |
| **Developer Onboarding** | Slower due to size and complexity                     | Faster—team-focused codebases                         |
| **Tooling Requirement**  | Requires advanced tooling (Bazel, Nx, Turborepo)      | Traditional Git + Jenkins/GitHub Actions work         |
| **Access Control**       | Harder to restrict access per team/module             | Fine-grained repo access control                      |
| **Refactoring**          | Easy to refactor across modules                       | Cross-repo refactoring is complex                     |
| **Build Performance**    | Needs caching or parallelization for efficiency       | Build scope is small per repo                         |
| **Scalability**          | Complex with large teams and repo size                | Highly scalable for growing microservice teams        |
| **Best for**             | Tightly coupled applications, internal tools, mono-CI | Loosely coupled microservices, cross-functional teams |

## 📝 Conclusion

Choosing between Monorepo and Microrepo depends on your **team size, project architecture, DevOps maturity, and deployment strategies**:

### 👉 Choose **Monorepo** when:

* You want to centralize workflows
* Projects are tightly coupled and share a lot of logic
* You require unified testing, versioning, and linting
* You have the right tooling in place (e.g., Nx, Turborepo)

### 👉 Choose **Microrepo** when:

* You follow microservices or distributed architecture
* Teams are independent and manage separate lifecycles
* You want granular access control
* You prioritize faster and isolated deployments

> 🔧 **Pro Tip**: A hybrid approach is also possible—monorepos for internal tools/libraries, microrepos for external-facing or independently deployable services.
